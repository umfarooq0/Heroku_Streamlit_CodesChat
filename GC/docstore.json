of 92  \nPC.1  INTRODUCTION  \nPC.1.1  The Planning Code  (\"PC\") specifies the technical and design criteria and procedures to be \napplied by The Company  in the planning and development of the National Electricity \nTransmission  System  and to be taken into account by Users  in the planning and \ndevelopment of their own Systems .  In the case of OTSUA , the PC also specifies  the technical \nand design criteria and procedures to be applied by the User in the planning and development \nof the OTSUA . It details information to be supplied by Users  to The Company , and certain \ninformat ion to be supplied by The Company  to Users . The Company  has obligations under \nthe STC to inform Relevant Transmission Licensees  of data required for the planning of the \nNational Electricity Transmission  System . In respect of PC data, The Company  may pass \non User  data to a Relevant Transmission Licensee , as detailed in PC.3.4 and PC.3.5 . \nPC.1.1A  Provisions of the PC which apply in relation to OTSDUW  and OTSUA  shall apply up to the \nOTSUA Transfer Time , whereupon such provisions shall (without preju dice to any prior non -\ncompliance) cease to apply, without prejudice to the continuing application of provisions of the \nPC applying in relation to the relevant Offshore Transmission System and/or Connection \nSite. \nPC.1.1B  As used in the PC: \n(a) National Elec tricity Transmission System  excludes OTSDUW Plant and Apparatus  \n(prior to the OTSUA Transfer Time ) unless the context otherwise requires;  \n(b) and User Development includes OTSDUW  unless the context otherwise requires.  \nPC.1.2  The Users  referred to above are  defined, for the purpose of the PC, in PC.3.1.  \nPC.1.3  Development of the National Electricity Transmission  System , involving its reinforcement \nor extension, will arise for a number of reasons including, but not limited to:  \n(a) a development on a User Sys tem already connected to the National Electricity \nTransmission  System ;  \n(b) the introduction of a new Connection Site  or the Modification  of an existing Connection \nSite between a User System  and the National Electricity Transmission  System ; \n(c) the cumulative effect of a number of such developments referred to in (a) and (b) by one \nor more Users . \nPC.1.4  Accordingly, the reinforcement or extension of the National Electricity Transmission  \nSystem  may involve work:  \n(a) at a substation at a Connection Site  where User's Plant  and/or Apparatus  is connected \nto the National Electricity Transmission  System  (or in the case of OTSDUW , at a \nsubstation at an Interface Point ); \n(b) on transmission lines or other facilities which joi n that Connection Site  (or in the case of \nOTSDUW , Interface Point ) to the remainder of the National Electricity Transmission  \nSystem ; \n(c) on transmission lines or other facilities at or between points remote from that Connection \nSite (or in the case of OTSD UW, Interface Point ). \nPC.1.5  The time required for the planning and development of the National Electricity Transmission  \nSystem  will depend on the type and extent of the necessary reinforcement and/or extension \nwork, the need or otherwise for statutory planning consent, the associated possibility of the \nneed for a public inquiry and the degree of  complexity in undertaking the new work while \nmaintaining satisfactory security and quality of supply on the existing National Electricity \nTransmission  System .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3493, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f9e57b4-aeb8-4e04-b15b-cfdd951a1962": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f9e57b4-aeb8-4e04-b15b-cfdd951a1962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae3bf1e2-2b24-453e-928c-e21c22b70fca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "hash": "28cca66325b79bf5b8e4766297b1ebccf801b4ad76d5f9a8d1702f8c2b424221"}, "3": {"node_id": "217d3bd0-0815-4bda-85bd-a0350830ffd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "hash": "cb7ec097cb07fe52154459b0ef80b07414b4eb6a74c020df032475b6308e482f"}}, "hash": "2b7039c3deb2379b5be5debdd562612f18299fe4d562539bdff06e22dbc282a5", "text": "Issue 6 Revision 16 PC 05 January  2023 \n 3 of 92 PC1.6  For the avoidance of doubt and the purposes  of the Grid Code, DC Connected Power Park \nModules  are treated as belonging  to Generators .

complied with by :  \n(i) any GB Code  User  connected to or seeking connection with the National \nElectricity Transmission System , or  \n(ii) GB Code  User \u2019s in respect of GB Generators  (other than in respect of Small \nPower Stations ) or GB Code  User\u2019s in respect of  DC Converter Station  owners \nconnected to or seeking connection to a User 's System  which is located in Great \nBritain  or Offshore , and   \n(b) the minimum technical, design and operational criteria with which The Company  will \ncomply in relation to the part of the National Electricity Transmission

In the case of any OTSDUW Plant and \nApparatus , the CC also specify the minimum technical, design and operational criteria \nwhich must be complied with by those GB Code  User s when undertaking OTSDUW . \n(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the requirements of these CC\u2019s  do not apply to EU Code  \nUser\u2019s  for whom the re quirements of the ECC\u2019s shall apply.    \n \nCC.2  OBJECTIVE  \nCC.2.1  The objective of the CC is to ensure that by specifying minimum technical, design and \noperational criteria , the basic rules for connection to the National Electricity Transmission \nSystem  and (for certain GB Code  User s) to a User 's System  are similar for all  GB Code  \nUser s of an  equivalent category and will enable The Company  to comply with its statutory \nand Transmission Licence  obligations.  \nCC.2.2 In the case of any OTSDUW , the objective of the CC is to ensure that by specifying the \nminimum technical, design and operational criteria , the basic rules relating to an Offshore \nTransmission System  designed and constructed by an Offshore Transmission Licensee  \nor designed and/or constructed by a n GB Code  User  under the OTSDUW Arrangements  are \nequivalent.  \nCC.2.3  Provisions of the CC which apply in relation to OTSDUW and OTSUA , and/or a Transmission \nInterface Site , shall (in any particular case) apply up to the OTSUA Transfer Time , \nwhereupon such provisions shall (without prejudice to any prior non -compliance) cease to \napply, without prejudice to the continuing application of provisions of the CC applying in \nrelati on to the relevant Offshore Transmission System  and/or Connection Site .  It is the \ncase therefore that in cases where the OTSUA  become s operational prior to the OTSUA \nTransfer Time  that a GB Generator is required to comply with this CC both as it applies t o its \nPlant and Apparatus  at a Connection Site \\Connection Point  and the OTSUA  at the \nTransmission Interface Site/Transmission Interface Point  until the OTSUA Transfer Time  \nand this CC shall be construed accordingly . \nCC.2.4  In relation to OTSDUW , provisions otherwise to be contained in a Bilateral Agreement  may \nbe contained in the Construction Agreement , and accordingly a reference in the CC to a \nrelevant Bilateral Agreement  includes the relevant Construction Agreement . \n \nCC.3  SCOPE  \nCC.3.1  The CC applies to The Company  and to GB Code  User s, which in the CC means:  \n(a) GB Generators  (other than those which only have Embedded  Small Power Stations ), \nincluding those undertaking OTSDUW ; \n(b) Network Operators ; \n(c) Non-Embedded Customers ;", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3428, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4483d05e-03c6-4fe0-8b4a-34b5e2be1d8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4483d05e-03c6-4fe0-8b4a-34b5e2be1d8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e604bfb-77af-48ea-9d50-4c2024f2c883", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "hash": "894fd8662fdfdbb213b11c4d2f4ab294785fdfa768eae0be90bc897cc7de5b7c"}}, "hash": "b42f7edf11ebf7e54f553dfb8670d4b8b0f35a934a739636245aa877dad0fc0c", "text": "Issue 6 Revision 16 CC 05 January 2023 \n 3 of 97 (d) DC Converter Station owners; and  \n(e) BM Participants and Externally Interconnected System Operators in respect of \nCC.6.5 only.  \nCC.3.2  The above categories of GB Code User  will become bound by the CC prior to them \ngenerating, distributing, supplying or consuming, as the case may be, and references to the \nvarious categories should, therefore, be taken as referring to them in that prospective role as \nwell as to GB Code User s actually connected.  \n \nCC.3.3  Embedded Medium Power Stations  not subject to a Bilateral Agreement  and Embedded \nDC Converter Stations  not subject to a Bilateral Agreement  Provisions.  \n The following provisions apply in respect of Embedded Medium Power Stations  not subject \nto a Bilateral Agreement  and Embedded DC Converter Stations  not subject to a Bilateral \nAgreement . \nCC.3.3.1  The obligations within the CC that are expressed to be applicable to GB Generators  in respect \nof Embedded Medium Power Stations  not subject to a Bilateral Agreement  and DC \nConverter Station Owners in respect of Embedded DC Converter Stations  not subject to a \nBilateral Agreement  (where the obligations are in each case listed in CC. 3.3.2 ) shall be read \nand construed as obligations that the Network Operator  within whose System  any such \nMedium Power Station  or DC Converter Station  is Embedded  must ensure are performed \nand discharged by the GB Generator  or the DC Converter Station  owner.

If a Generating Unit  or CCGT \nModule  or Power Park Module  or DC Converter  is operating below Minimum Generation  \nbecause of high System Frequency , it should rec over adequately to its  Minimum Generation  \nlevel as the System Frequency  returns to Target Frequency  so that it can provide Primary  \nand Secondary Response  from Minimum Generation  if the System Frequency  continues \nto fall.  For the avoidance of doubt, under normal operating conditions steady state operation \nbelow Minimum Generation  is not expected.

It may \nbe necessary to specify values outside this range where  The Company  identifies a system \nneed, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary The Company  may specify in the Bilateral \nAgreement  values outside of the ranges provided in this Appendix 6. The most co mmon \nvariations are in the on -load excitation ceiling voltage requirements and the response time \nrequired of the Exciter .

In addition to the requirements defined in \nECC.6.3.7 this appendix defines the minimum frequency response requirements for: -  \n(a) each Type C  and Type D  Power Generating Module  \n(b) each DC Connected Power Park Module  \n(c) each HVDC System  \n  \n  For the avoidance of doubt, this appendix does not apply to Type A and Type B Power \nGenerating Modules .  \n OTSDUW Plant and Apparatus  should facilitate the delivery of frequency response services \nprovided by Offshore Generating Units  and Offshore  Power Park Units .  \n The functional definition provides appropriate performance criteria relating to the provision of \nFrequency  control by means of Frequency  sensitive generation in addition to the other \nrequirements identified in ECC.6.3.7.  \n In this Appe ndix 3 to the E CC, for a Power Generating Module  including a CCGT Module  or \na Power Park Module  or DC Connected Power Park Module , the phrase Minimum \nRegulating Level  applies to the entire CCGT Module  or Power Park Module  or DC \nConnected Power Park Module  operating with all Generating Units Synchronised  to the \nSystem . \n The minimum Frequency response requirement profile is shown diagrammatically in Figure \nECC.A.3.1.  The capability profile specifies the minimum required level of Frequency \nResponse Capability  throughout the normal plant operating range.  \nECC.A.3.2  Plant Operating Range  \n The upper limit of the operating range is the Maximum Capacity  of the Power Generating \nModule  or Generating Unit  or CCGT Module  or HVDC Equipment . \n The Minimum Stable Operating Level   may be less than, but must not be more than, 65% \nof the Maximum Capacity .  Each Power Generating Module  and/or Generating Unit  and/or \nCCGT Module and/or  Power Park Module or HVDC Equipment  must be capable of \noperating satisfactorily  down to the Minimum Regulating Level  as dictated by System  \noperating conditions, although it will not be instructed to below its Minimum Stable Operating \nLevel  .  If a Power Generating Module  or Generating Unit  or CCGT Module  or Power Park \nModule , or HVDC  Equipment is operating below Minimum Stable Operating Level  because \nof high System Frequency , it should recover adequately to its  Minimum Stable Operating \nLevel  as the System Frequency  returns to Target Frequency  so that it can provide Primary  \nand Seconda ry Response  from its Minimum Stable Operating Level  if the System \nFrequency  continues to fall.  For the avoidance of doubt, under normal operating conditions \nsteady state operation below the Minimum Stable Operating Level  is not expected. The  \nMinimum Regulating Level  must not be more than 55% of Maximum Capacity . \n In the event of a Power Generating Module  or Generating Unit  or CCGT Module  or Power \nPark Module or HVDC Equipment load rejecting down to no less than its  Minimum \nRegulating Level  it should not trip as a result of automatic action as detailed in BC3.7.  If the \nload rejection is to a level less than the  Minimum Regulating Level  then it is accepted that \nthe condition might be so severe as to cause it to be disconnected from the System . \nECC.A.3.3  Minimum Frequency Response Requirement Profile", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3539, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56fc4dd0-c826-4fe1-976a-4b1669cc28c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "56fc4dd0-c826-4fe1-976a-4b1669cc28c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c153027e-9591-4d98-8795-b78548bbffb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "hash": "42cbb26d543b9ec0b851cc4d162be3a82a6185ce2b273c6692f8311a29f7b3ed"}, "3": {"node_id": "72a79bab-602b-43a4-a204-16917602782a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "GridCode.pdf"}, "hash": "cca3d1c3b1324e12342f4cf6e514a2c5ef404dda2fc7af521357b2e44be45dab"}}, "hash": "672e135b8c3165e900f00da1810650905d4ce82e0920ce3d7dd6ac2ec6aa5677", "text": "Issue 6 Revision 16 ECC 05 January  2023 \n 110 of 140 \n  Figure ECC.A.3.1 shows the minimum Frequency  response capability requirement profile \ndiagrammatically for a 0.5 Hz change in Frequency .  The percentage response capabilities \nand loading levels are defined on the basis of the Maximum Capacity  of the Power \nGenerating Module or CCGT Module  or Power Par k Module or HVDC Equipment .  Each \nPower Generating Module  or and/or CCGT Module  or Power Park Module  (including a DC \nConnected Power Park Module ) and/or HVDC Equipment  must be capable of operating in \na manner to provide Frequency  response at least to the s olid boundaries shown in the figure.  \nIf the Frequency  response capability falls within the solid boundaries, the Power Generating \nModule  or CCGT Module or Power Park Module  or HVDC Equipment  is providing response \nbelow the minimum requirement which is not  acceptable.  Nothing in this appendix is intended \nto prevent a Power Generating Module  or CCGT Module  or Power Park Module  or HVDC \nEquipment  from being designed to deliver a Frequency  response in excess of the identified \nminimum requirement.  \n The Frequency  response delivered for Frequency  deviations of less than 0.5 Hz should be \nno less than a figure which is directly proportional to the minimum Frequency  response \nrequirement for a Frequency  deviation of 0.5 Hz.  For example, if the Frequency  deviation is \n0.2 Hz, the corresponding minimum Frequency  response requirement is 40% of the level \nshown in Figure ECC.A.3.1.  The Frequency  response delivered for Frequency  deviations of \nmore than 0.5 Hz should be no less than the response delivered for a Frequency  deviation of \n0.5 Hz.  \n Each Power Generating Module  and/or CCGT Module and/or  Power Park Module  or HVDC \nEquipment must be capable of providing some response, in keeping with its specific \noperational characteristics, when operating between 95% to 100% of Maximum Capacity  as \nillustrated by the dotted lines in Figure ECC.A.3.1.  \n At the Minimum Stable Operating level, each Power Generating Module  and/or CCGT \nModule and/or  Power Park Module and/or HV DC Equipment  is required to provide high \nand low frequency response depending on the System Frequency  conditions. Where the \nFrequency  is high, the Active Power  output is therefore expected to fall below the Minimum \nStable Operating  level.  \n The Minim um Regulating Level  is the output at which a Power Generating Module  and/or \nCCGT Module  and/or Power Park Module   and/or HV DC Equipment  has no High \nFrequency Response  capability.  It may be less than, but must not be more than, 55% of the \nMaximum Capacity .  This implies that a Power Generating Module  or CCGT Module  or \nPower Park Module  ) or HVDC Equipment  is not obliged to reduce its output to below this \nlevel unless the Frequency  is at or above 50.5 Hz (cf BC3.7).  \nECC.A.3.4  Testing of Frequency Response Capability  \n The frequency response capabilities shown diagrammatically in Figure ECC.A.3.1 are \nmeasured by taking the responses as obtained from some of the dynamic step response tests \nspecified by The Company  and carried out by Generators  and HV DC System owners for \ncompliance purposes.

In summary any  Power Generating Module (including a  DC \nConnected Power Park Module ) or HVDC System   is required to  remain connected and \nstable whilst connected to a healthy circuit. Figure ECC.A.4.A.2 illustrates th is principle.  \n   \n \nFigure ECC.A.4.A.2  \n \nIn Figure ECC.A.4.A.2  a solid three phase short circuit fault is applied adjacent to substation \nA resulting in zero voltage at the point of fault. All circuit breakers on the faulty circuit (Lines \nABC) will open within 140ms resulting in Gen X tripping.  The effect of this fau lt, due to the low \nimpedance of the network, will be the observation of a low voltage at each substation node \nacross the Total System  until the fault has been cleared. In this example, Gen Y and Gen Z \n(an Embedded Generator) would need to remain connected and stable as both are still \nconnected to the Total  System and remain connected to healthy circuits  .  \n \n The criteria for assessment is based on a voltage against time curve at each Grid Entry Point \nor User System Entry Point .

The control performance requirements applicable to  Configurati on 2 AC \nConnected Offshore Power Park Modules  and Configuration 2  DC Connected Power \nPark Modules  are defined in Appendix E8.  \nECC.A.7.1.2  Proposals by EU Generators  or HVDC System Owners  to make a change to the voltage \ncontrol systems a re required to be notified to The Company  under the Planning Code  \n(PC.A.1.2(b) and (c)) as soon as the Generator  or HVDC System Owner  anticipates making \nthe change.
