Introduction \nRole and Scope  \n 1.1 Pursuant to conditions C17, D3 and E16 of the Transmission Licences, this  \ndocument sets out a coordinated set  of criteria and methodologies (for example \ncost-benefit techniques and weather related operation) that transmission \nlicensees shall use in the planning and operation of the national electricity \ntransmission system of Great Britain . For the avoidance of do ubt the national \nelectricity transmission system is made up of both the onshore transmission \nsystem and the offshore transmission systems . \n 1.2 Both planning and operational criteria are set out in this Standard and these will  \ndetermine the need for services provided to the relevant transmission licensees , \ne.g. reactive power as well as transmission equipment. The planning criteria set \nout the requirements for the transmission capacity (either investment or purchase \nof services) for the national electricity transmission system . The planning criteria \nalso require consideration to be given to the operation and maintenance of the \nnational electricity transmission system and so refer to the associated operational \ncriteria where appropriate. The operational criteria are used in real time and in the \ndevelopment of plans for using the national electricity transmission system to \npermit satisfactory operation.  \n 1.3 Additional criteria, for example  covering more detailed and other aspects of  \nquality of supply, are contained in the Grid Code and the SO -TO Code, which \nshould be read in conjunction with this document.  \n1.4 External interconnections between the onshore transmission system and external \nsystems (e.g. in Ireland & France) are covered by separate agreements, which \nwill normally be consistent with this Standard. This Standard may be specifically \nreferenced in the relevant agreements and shall apply to the extent of that \nreference.  \n 1.5 The con sideration of secured events as defined in this Standard may lead to  \nthe identification of inadequate capability of equipment or systems not owned or \noperated by the transmission licensees (for example, the overloading of lower \nvoltage connections between grid supply points ). In such cases the transmission \nlicensees will notify the network operators affected. Reinforcement or alternative \noperation of the national electricity transmission system to alleviate inadequacies \nof equipment or systems not owned or operated by the transmission licensees \nwould be undertaken where it is agreed by the network operators affected and the \nrelevant transmission licensees . \n 1.6 The criteria presented in this Standard represent the minimum requirements for  \nthe planning and op eration of the national electricity transmission system . While \nit is a requirement for transmission capacity to meet the planning criteria, it does \nnot follow that the transmission capacity should be reduced so that it only meets \nthe minimum requirement of  those criteria. For example, it may not be beneficial \nto reduce the ratings of lines to reflect lower loading levels which have arisen due \nto changes in the generation or demand patterns.  \nNational Electricity Transmission System Security and Quality of Supply Standard, Version 2.5, 01 April 2021  4", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3256, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d22b88cc-e885-4503-b8b9-8bd4450a4699": {"__data__": {"id_": "d22b88cc-e885-4503-b8b9-8bd4450a4699", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "SQSS.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bad44c4c-47c3-4827-9d16-cc15e47bbb36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "SQSS.pdf"}, "hash": "866732e2d6a9317d9b66cb61b7f4f03b965b51d353bf642a05677a725be1b958"}}, "hash": "95d33e3e694d294396cba50739041f32b4de8c1d3e594b098a819c3390acc479", "text": "Document Structure  \n 1.7 This Standard contains technical terms and phrases specific to transmission  \nsystems and the Electricity Supply Industry.

The output of plant in this category is uniformly \nscaled by a variable factor that is calculated to ensure that generation \nand demand balance. This is described in E.5.  \nE.2 The NGESO will from time -to-time review, consult on, and publish the \ncategorisation of plant.  \nDirectly Scaled Plant  \nE.3 In the Economy planned transfer condition the registered capacities of certain  \nclasses of power station are scaled by fixed factors, known as D T, for classes T of \npower station . These factors are set as follows:  \nE.3.1 For nuclear stations, and for coal -fired and gas -fired stations fitted with Carbon \nCapture and Storage, D T = 0.85  \nE.3.2 For stations powered by wind, wave, or tides, D T = 0.70. \nE.3.3 For pumped storage based stations, D T = 0.5  \nE.3.4 For interconnectors to external systems regarded as importing into GB at the \ntime of peak demand, D T = 1.0  \nE.4 The NGESO will review the appropriateness of these factors and revise them  \nwhere necessary, based on alignment with cost benefit analysis. The period \nbetween reviews shall be no more than five year s, but may be less if required.  \nVariably Scaled Plant  \nE.5 All remaining power stations and on the system at the time of the ACS peak  \ndemand are considered contributory and their output is calculated by applying a \nscaling factor to their registered capacity such that their aggregate output is equal to \nthe forecast ACS peak demand minus the total output of directly scaled plant.  \nE.6 Thus,   \n0 for non  - contributory plant  PTi \n \n \n for directly scaled plant \nfor variably scaled plant  D  R  \nT x DT i SxRVTi \nNational Electricity Transmission System Security and Quality of Supply Standard, Version 2.5, 01 April 2021  90", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c6a6e0-b263-4b71-8d0c-b18dc37799a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c6a6e0-b263-4b71-8d0c-b18dc37799a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "SQSS.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aaa12466-d6e6-4f68-94b4-10cd439babc6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "SQSS.pdf"}, "hash": "737b9db77b0a9354ec9de03ca016dcbe26720bba76d0ddedb27e985118e2fbb7"}}, "hash": "ecff6ca47c8f31711c73bde34da467951a28d03dfc11dea316368c96c6633634", "text": "where  \n P \n ( ) \n \n \nloss + L j \u2212 D T x R DT k \nj DT \n k \n  \n \n \nVT\n n \nand \nPTi = the output of the ith power station of generation plant type T \nDT = the direct scaling factor for directly scaled generation of plant type T \nRDTk = the registered capacity of the kth power station of generation plant type \nDT in the directly scaled category  \nRVTn = the registered capacity of the nth power station of generation plant type \nVT in the variably scaled category  \nPloss = total national electricity transmission system active power losses at time \nof ACS peak demand  \nLj = the active power demand at the jth national electricity transmission  \nsystem demand site at the time of ACS peak demand   \n= S \nNational Electricity Transmission System Security and Quality of Supply Standard, Version 2.5, 01 April 2021  91  \n \n RVTn", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 826, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8571f5e0-2b36-4071-881e-0bad4e70f845": {"__data__": {"id_": "8571f5e0-2b36-4071-881e-0bad4e70f845", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "SQSS.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3e88296-de5b-4274-a997-a18969c0a386", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "SQSS.pdf"}, "hash": "be683478109a36c7fbbba8825736c3edc43e8b42248569cbbca203920fbf58bd"}}, "hash": "1c94bcb3e08a5f186796d0e713ddf8c1f3075035a0468718d8b70d9b18e8e963", "text": "Appendix F  Application of the Boundary Allowance  \nF.1 This appendix outlines the techniques underlying the use of the boundary  \nallowance under paragraphs 4.4.4 and 4.4.5.  \nF.2 The modification of the MITS Economy planned transfer condition power flow  \npattern to reflect a boundary allowance shall apply to the national electricity \ntransmission system divided into any two contiguous parts, irrespective of the size or \nlocation of the parts.  \nF.3 The boundary allowance is applied by: - \nF.3.1 summing the demand and the total active power generation output \n(including imports from external systems ) under the Economy planned \ntransfer condition within the smaller of the two parts;
